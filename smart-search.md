# Smart Search Component

## Overview
Create a reusable search component with autocomplete functionality that helps users find countries. The component should demonstrate your understanding of React best practices, state management, and user experience considerations.

## Core Requirements

### UI Elements
- Search input field with search icon
- Dropdown showing filtered results
- Clear button (appears when input has text)
- Loading indicator
- "No results found" message when appropriate

### Search Functionality
- Begin searching after user types 3 characters
- Implement 300ms debounce on search
- Mock API call with 500ms delay
- Highlight matching text in search results
- Search through both country names and capitals

### Sample Data Structure
```javascript
const countries = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'United States',
    capital: 'Washington DC',
    population: '331M'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'United Kingdom',
    capital: 'London',
    population: '67M'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'France',
    capital: 'Paris',
    population: '67M'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: 'Germany',
    capital: 'Berlin',
    population: '83M'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: 'Italy',
    capital: 'Rome',
    population: '60M'
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    name: 'Spain',
    capital: 'Madrid',
    population: '47M'
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    name: 'Canada',
    capital: 'Ottawa',
    population: '38M'
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    name: 'Australia',
    capital: 'Canberra',
    population: '25M'
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    name: 'Japan',
    capital: 'Tokyo',
    population: '126M'
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    name: 'Brazil',
    capital: 'Bras√≠lia',
    population: '212M'
  }
]
```
